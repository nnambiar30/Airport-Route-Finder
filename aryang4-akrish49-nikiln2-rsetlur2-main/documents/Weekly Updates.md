Since all of us are currently off campus we decided do a zoom call. We laid down the foundation for our bfs traversal algorithm. We are working on creating an airport class as well as implementing the OpenFlight dataset within our program. We are using the Haversine formula to calculate the distance between two coordinates. As in our proposal we implemented the distance as weighted edges and the airports as vertices. Lastly, we created empty files for the basis of our project.

Finished BFS Traversal as well as creating a makefile to compile changes. 

12/7/21
Finished implementing A* algorithm and created print test cases for farthest airport and closest airport to Chicago O' Hare. Created methods to follow path from starting airport to destination airport. 

12/9/21
Finished implenting Kruskal algorithm and created print test cases for the number routes to compare it to.

Finished creating test cases for A* star algorithm, Kruskal, and BFS. Created smaller files for routes and airports to test findings. We used DFW, CMI, ORD, LAX, and CAR airports. CAR does not have any connections, so we were able to test a larger amount of potential errors. We also created bad files to check for edge cases in the reading of the files. Made small adjustments in A* to allow for testing such as the creation of the print method.
