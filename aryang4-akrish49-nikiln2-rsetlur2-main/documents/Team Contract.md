Team Contract (rsetlur2, nikiln2, akrish49, aryang4)

Communication:

	Team Meetings: Our team will meet every Saturday from 1-3pm. These meetings will take place at our apartment, in person, as we are all roommates. In the case we are away, we will meet online through zoom. Our notes will be recorded and the person delegated to record starting with Nikil Nambiar (nikiln2) will rotate every week.

	Assistance: Since we are roommates, all our team members are able to communicate with each other in person if we ever need help on this project. We are also able to communicate virtually if needed, via text or Zoom. All of our group members would give assistance to any group member as soon as possible. 

	Respect: We will ensure that every member has an opportunity to speak by having open discussions with all the members. So, if a member has an issue with something, or has something to contribute, then they would be able to discuss all the members to make sure their voices are heard. Using this weâ€™ll also be able to make sure that all the members are actively listening to whatever the other members have to say.

Collaboration:
	
	Work Distribution: Each week we will have two members of our group work on the weekly deliverables. Members can volunteer to do the weekly tasks, but if one member is doing a majority of the work or one is not doing enough adjustments can be made. If there are no volunteers there will be a random drawing to decide who is going to be tasked with the deliverables.

	Time Commitment: We have given ourselves a mandatory 2 hour meeting on Saturday. Additionally each member is expected to work 3-4 hours a week on the project. However, we are aware that more time might be needed, but it will be easy to provide ourselves with more time since we all live together. Any issues we have can be resolved with no lag in communication.

	Conflict Resolution: Our team will resolve disagreements through majority voting. Since we are roommates, we can hold ourselves accountable in person, and we know how to resolve conflicts between us. Any situation or issue that occurs will first be discussed by us, and we will ensure the conversation stays respectful, as we do not want to jeopardize our group work or our relationships.
